# Building Construction Website

The Building Construction Website is a responsive, multi-page static website designed to represent a construction company's services, ongoing projects, and contact information. Developed using HTML5 and CSS3, the project focuses on clean design, user-friendly navigation, and a visual-rich layout that uses construction-related imagery to enhance user experience.

The website is structured into several distinct sections, each served by its own HTML file. The index.html serves as the homepage, providing an overview of the company and its offerings. Additional pages include about.html for information about the company, contact.html for user inquiries, offer.html for showcasing deals or discounts, project.html for listing completed or ongoing construction projects, and service.html to present various services offered by the company. Styling is handled through a dedicated stylesheet located in CSS/main.css, and the project also includes images and an audio file to make the user experience more engaging.

This project does not include backend functionality, making it ideal as a frontend-only prototype or demo for academic or small business presentation purposes. To run the website, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. All other pages are interconnected for smooth navigation.

This project was developed by Rajapnisha, a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) student, as part of academic coursework. It demonstrates proficiency in basic web development concepts and the ability to create structured, multi-page websites for real-world use cases.
